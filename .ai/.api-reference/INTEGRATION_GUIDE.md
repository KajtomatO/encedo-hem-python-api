# Encedo HEM Library -- Integration Guide for Language Bindings

This document captures implementation details, non-obvious behaviors, and lessons
learned from the C reference implementation (`libhem`). Its purpose is to give
agents or developers building bindings in other languages (Python, Rust, Go, etc.)
a complete picture without having to reverse-engineer the device protocol.

---

## 1. What the library does

`libhem` wraps the Encedo HEM (Hardware Encryption Module) REST API. The device
is a USB or rack-mount HSM that **never exposes key material** -- all crypto
operations happen on the device. The library handles:

- Transport (HTTPS to the device)
- The custom eJWT authentication protocol (challenge-response using X25519 + HMAC-SHA256)
- JSON serialization / deserialization
- Token caching and automatic re-authentication
- The two-phase internet check-in flow

The device REST API is documented in the `encedo-hem-api-doc` repo (endpoint
reference with Encedo Manager source code cross-references).

---

## 2. Transport layer

### 2.1 HTTPS with TLS verification disabled

The device uses HTTPS (TLS 1.3) but its certificate is self-signed or issued by
the Encedo CA, not a public CA. **TLS peer/host verification must be disabled.**
Device authenticity is established out-of-band via the check-in protocol (Section 6).

In libcurl terms: `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER = 0`, `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST = 0`.
In Python `requests`: `verify=False`. In Rust `reqwest`: `.danger_accept_invalid_certs(true)`.

### 2.2 No connection reuse -- critical

The device's embedded HTTP server **closes the TCP connection after every response**.
If you reuse a connection (keep-alive), the next request will fail with a send error
(libcurl: `CURLE_SEND_ERROR`, Python requests: `ConnectionError`).

**Always open a new connection per request.**

- libcurl: `CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE = 1`
- Python `requests`: use a plain `requests.get/post()` call (not a `Session`), or
  set `session.headers['Connection'] = 'close'`
- Rust `reqwest`: build the client with `.connection_verbose(true)` or use
  `ClientBuilder` with `pool_max_idle_per_host(0)`

This was discovered empirically -- POST requests after a prior POST would fail
until per-request connections were enforced.

### 2.3 Base URL

The base URL has no trailing slash: `https://my.ence.do`.
All paths begin with `/api/...`.

### 2.4 Content-Type

All request and response bodies are `application/json`.
POST bodies must set `Content-Type: application/json`.

### 2.5 Max POST body

The device rejects bodies larger than **7300 bytes** (5 × MTU) with HTTP 413.
Validate plaintext size before encrypting: base64 overhead means the actual
usable plaintext is ≈ 5475 bytes minus the JSON wrapper.

### 2.6 ICMP ping

HEM devices respond to ICMP echo requests (standard `ping`). This is useful
as a fast network-layer reachability probe before any HTTPS connection attempt.

Note that ICMP may be blocked by firewalls or container networking — absence
of a ping reply does not guarantee the HTTPS API is unreachable. For
API-level liveness, use `GET /api/system/version` (unauthenticated, always
available when the device is operational).

### 2.7 Binary uploads (firmware / bootloader)

Firmware and bootloader upload endpoints (`POST /api/system/upgrade/upload_fw`,
`upload_ui`, `upload_bootldr`) use a different content type than the JSON API:

- `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`
- `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="<name>"`
- `Expect: 100-continue`

The 7300-byte body limit does **not** apply to binary uploads. Firmware binaries
are much larger; the device streams them directly to flash.

### 2.8 Firmware verification polling

After uploading firmware, call the corresponding `check_*` endpoint to poll for
verification status:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Verification complete — safe to install |
| 201 / 202 | Still processing — retry after interval |
| 406 | Verification failed — do not install |

Polling cadence (per `encedo-hem-api-doc`, OQ-10 resolved):
- `check_fw`: poll every **4 seconds**
- `check_ui`: wait **60 seconds** before first poll, then every **5 seconds**

---

## 3. Authentication protocol (eJWT)

This is the most complex part and the most likely source of bugs in new bindings.

### 3.1 Overview

The device uses a custom challenge-response scheme called **eJWT** (Encedo JWT).
It is a standard JWT (header.payload.signature) but the signing key is derived
from the user's passphrase and the device's X25519 public key via ECDH, rather
than a stored secret.

**No passphrase ever leaves the client machine.**

### 3.2 Step-by-step flow

```
1. GET /api/auth/token
   Response: { "eid": "<salt>", "spk": "<device_x25519_pubkey_b64>",
               "jti": "<nonce>", "exp": <deadline_ts>, "lbl": "<label>" }

2. seed = PBKDF2-SHA256(passphrase, eid, iterations=600000, dklen=32)
   -- 'eid' is the salt, NOT the passphrase
   -- 600000 iterations is intentional (security requirement FPT_AFL.1)
   -- expect this to take ~1 second on a modern CPU

3. privkey = X25519_private_key_from_raw_bytes(seed)
   -- the 32-byte seed IS the private key scalar directly (no further hashing)

4. pubkey  = X25519_public_key_from_private(privkey)
   -- used as the 'iss' claim (standard base64, WITH padding)

5. shared  = X25519_ECDH(privkey, base64_decode(spk))
   -- spk is standard base64, decode to 32 raw bytes first
   -- shared secret is 32 bytes

6. Build JWT:
   header  = {"ecdh":"x25519","alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}   (always this exact string)
   payload = {
     "jti":   "<jti from challenge>",
     "aud":   "<spk from challenge -- the original base64 string, NOT decoded>",
     "exp":   <requested_token_expiry_unix_ts>,
     "iat":   <now_unix_ts>,
     "iss":   "<base64_standard(pubkey)>",
     "scope": "<requested_scope>"
   }
   h   = base64url_nopad(utf8(header_json))
   p   = base64url_nopad(utf8(payload_json))
   sig = HMAC-SHA256(key=shared_secret, message=h + "." + p)
   ejwt = h + "." + p + "." + base64url_nopad(sig)

7. POST /api/auth/token
   Body: {"auth": "<ejwt>"}
   Response: {"token": "<jwt_access_token>"}

8. Cache the JWT. Use as: Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

### 3.3 Base64 conventions -- two different encodings in use

| Where | Encoding | Padding |
|---|---|---|
| API message payloads (`msg`, `aad`, `ciphertext`, etc.) | Standard base64 (RFC 4648 §4) | Yes (`=`) |
| Device public key `spk` in auth challenge | Standard base64 | Yes |
| User public key `iss` in eJWT payload | Standard base64 | Yes |
| JWT segments (header, payload, signature) | base64**url** (RFC 4648 §5) | **No** (`+`→`-`, `/`→`_`, strip `=`) |

Mixing these up is the most common bug. JWT uses base64url without padding;
everything else uses standard base64 with padding.

### 3.4 Token scopes

Every JWT is bound to **one scope string**. Re-authenticate to change scope.
The library gets a new token automatically when the scope needed differs from
the cached token's scope.

| Operation | Scope |
|---|---|
| Read device config | `system:config` |
| Create/derive keys | `keymgmt:gen` |
| Import public keys | `keymgmt:imp` |
| List keys | `keymgmt:list` |
| Get a public key | `keymgmt:get` (per spec) — but in practice firmware v1.2.2-DIAG only accepts `keymgmt:use:<KID>`; see OQ-16 |
| Update key metadata | `keymgmt:upd` |
| Delete keys | `keymgmt:del` |
| Search keys | `keymgmt:search` |
| Any crypto operation on key X | `keymgmt:use:<KID>` (per-key) |
| Read audit logs | `logger:get` |
| Upgrade firmware | `system:upgrade` |
| Storage lock/unlock | `storage:disk0:rw` etc. |

The `keymgmt:use:<KID>` scope is dynamic -- it embeds the 32-char hex KID.
A new token is needed for each key used in crypto operations, unless the
previous token already covers that KID.

### 3.5 Token expiry

- Request `exp = now + 3600` (1 hour) in the eJWT payload.
- The challenge's `exp` field is the challenge deadline (not the token lifetime).
- Cap `req_exp` at the challenge's `exp` if it is smaller.
- Cached tokens should be considered expired **60 seconds before** their `exp`
  to account for clock skew and network latency.

### 3.6 Auth throttling (FPT_AFL.1)

The device enforces brute-force protection on `POST /api/auth/token`:
- Minimum response time: **500 ms**
- After 3 failed attempts: response time increases to **1500 ms** (3×)
- Throttle resets after ~15 seconds of successful authentications

Do not retry 401s in tight loops.

### 3.7 Role

- `HEM_ROLE_USER` (`sub` = `U`) -- regular operations
- `HEM_ROLE_MASTER` (`sub` = `M`) -- administrative operations

Role is implicit in which X25519 key was used to initialize the device.
The passphrase for user and master are different; use the correct one.

### 3.8 Sensitive material handling

- Zero the 32-byte PBKDF2 seed and the 32-byte ECDH shared secret immediately
  after constructing the eJWT.
- Store the passphrase in a dedicated zeroed buffer; zero it on context destroy.
- The JWT token itself is not sensitive (it is bearer-style, short-lived, scoped).

---

## 4. Device personalization (auth/init)

`POST /api/auth/init` initializes an un-personalized device. The eJWT payload
includes a `cfg` object with the full device configuration:

```json
{
  "jti": "<from_challenge>",
  "aud": "<device_spk>",
  "exp": "<from_challenge>",
  "iat": "<current_timestamp>",
  "iss": "<admin_public_key_base64>",
  "cfg": {
    "masterkey": "<admin_x25519_pubkey_b64>",
    "userkey": "<user_x25519_pubkey_b64>",
    "user": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "hostname": "prefix.ence.do",
    "ip": "192.168.7.1",
    "storage_mode": 81,
    "storage_disk0size": 8388608,
    "dnsd": false,
    "trusted_ts": true,
    "trusted_backend": true,
    "allow_keysearch": true,
    "gen_csr": true,
    "origin": "*"
  }
}
```

| Config field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `masterkey` | string | Admin X25519 public key (base64) |
| `userkey` | string | User X25519 public key (base64) |
| `user` | string | User display name |
| `email` | string | User email |
| `hostname` | string | Device FQDN |
| `ip` | string | Device IP address (PPA only, EPA ignores) |
| `storage_mode` | integer | Storage configuration (PPA only) |
| `storage_disk0size` | integer | Disk0 size in bytes (PPA only) |
| `dnsd` | boolean | Enable DNS daemon (PPA only) |
| `trusted_ts` | boolean | Trust backend timestamps |
| `trusted_backend` | boolean | Trust backend for check-in |
| `allow_keysearch` | boolean | Allow unauthenticated key search by `descr` |
| `gen_csr` | boolean | Generate CSR during init |
| `origin` | string | CORS origin |

Response: `{ "instanceid", "token", "csr", "genuine" }`.
Returns **406** if device is already initialized.

## 5. Key management

### 5.1 KID format

Key IDs are **32 lowercase hex characters** (128-bit identifiers), e.g.:
`0382e3eab596598b1f3582ef90b61a0e`

### 5.2 Key type strings

Pass these exactly as shown to `/api/keymgmt/create`:

| Category | Type strings |
|---|---|
| AES | `AES128`, `AES192`, `AES256` |
| NIST ECC | `SECP256R1`, `SECP384R1`, `SECP521R1`, `SECP256K1` |
| Curve25519/448 | `CURVE25519`, `CURVE448`, `ED25519`, `ED448` |
| HMAC | `SHA2-256`, `SHA2-384`, `SHA2-512`, `SHA3-256`, `SHA3-384`, `SHA3-512` |
| Post-Quantum KEM | `MLKEM512`, `MLKEM768`, `MLKEM1024` |
| Post-Quantum DSA | `MLDSA44`, `MLDSA65`, `MLDSA87` |

### 5.2.1 List pagination

`GET /api/keymgmt/list/{offset}/{limit}` has a documented **default `limit` of 15**
when omitted. Empirically the device also caps the *honoured* limit at 15 even
when a larger value is requested (`listed=15` for `limit=64`). Treat 15 as the
maximum effective page size and always paginate via `offset` until
`offset + listed >= total`. Do **not** use `listed < requested_limit` as the
end-of-list signal.

### 5.3 Key type string in list response

The `type` field in a list or get response is a **comma-separated attribute string**,
not the creation type. Example: `"PKEY,ECDH,ExDSA,SECP256R1"`. Parse it by
splitting on `,` -- the last element is the algorithm; earlier elements are flags
(`PKEY` = has private key, `ECDH` = supports ECDH, `ExDSA` = supports signing).

### 5.4 Key search

`POST /api/keymgmt/search` returns **HTTP 404** when no keys match the pattern
(not an empty list). The `descr` value is base64-encoded; prefix with `^` for
starts-with matching.

### 5.5 Key deletion and FLS state

`DELETE /api/keymgmt/delete/{kid}` returns **HTTP 409** if the device is in a
failure state (`fls_state != 0`). Handle this gracefully. The device's FLS state
is reported in `GET /api/system/status` → `fls_state` bitmask:

| Bit | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | Entropy source failure |
| 1 | 2 | Firmware integrity failure |
| 2 | 4 | Temperature out of range |

A value of 4 (temp only) was observed at 87°C during testing; the device
recovered to FLS=0 after cooling. Crypto operations other than delete were
unaffected at FLS=4.

---

## 6. Check-in protocol

Check-in synchronizes the device with the Encedo backend, sets the RTC clock,
and verifies firmware integrity. It requires **outbound internet access** to
`https://api.encedo.com`.

```
1. GET  {device}/api/system/checkin
   Response body: {"check": "<opaque_challenge>"}

2. POST https://api.encedo.com/checkin
   Body: the entire JSON object from step 1 (forward verbatim)
   Response body: {"checked": "<opaque_response>"}

3. POST {device}/api/system/checkin
   Body: the entire JSON object from step 2 (forward verbatim)
   Response: {"status": "OK"}
```

No authentication required for any step.
Side effects: RTC clock set, firmware integrity verified.
The device's `ts` field in `/api/system/status` will be non-null after check-in.

---

## 7. Crypto operations

### 7.1 Encrypt / Decrypt

All message fields are **standard base64 with padding** in both directions.

Encrypt request:
```json
{"kid": "<kid>", "alg": "AES256-GCM", "msg": "<base64(plaintext)>"}
```

Encrypt response:
```json
{"ciphertext": "<base64>", "iv": "<base64_16bytes>", "tag": "<base64_16bytes>"}
```

Decrypt request:
```json
{"kid": "<kid>", "alg": "AES256-GCM",
 "msg": "<base64(ciphertext)>", "iv": "<base64>", "tag": "<base64>"}
```

Decrypt response:
```json
{"plaintext": "<base64(plaintext)>"}
```

For GCM: IV is 16 bytes, tag is 16 bytes. Both are always present in the response.
For CBC: IV is present, tag is absent. For ECB: neither IV nor tag.

**TLS is required** for all crypto endpoints (`/api/crypto/*`). Since the device
may not have TLS operational (status `https: false`) during early setup, crypto
calls may fail with HTTP 418 until TLS is configured via check-in + provisioning.

### 7.2 Algorithm strings

AES modes: `AES128-ECB`, `AES192-ECB`, `AES256-ECB`,
           `AES128-CBC`, `AES192-CBC`, `AES256-CBC`,
           `AES128-GCM`, `AES192-GCM`, `AES256-GCM`

ECB requires message length to be a multiple of 16 bytes.
CBC and GCM accept any length (CBC uses PKCS#7 padding).

### 7.3 ECDH-derived crypto keys

All crypto endpoints (`hmac/hash`, `hmac/verify`, `cipher/encrypt`, `cipher/decrypt`,
`cipher/wrap`, `cipher/unwrap`) accept optional `ext_kid` or `pubkey` fields. When
provided, the operation key is derived on-device via ECDH rather than using `kid`
directly:

- **HMAC**: `HMAC_key = Hash(X25519(kid_priv, peer_pub))`. The `alg` field selects
  the hash algorithm used for both the derivation and the HMAC itself.
- **Cipher**: `raw = X25519(kid_priv, peer_pub)` → `aesKey = HKDF-SHA256(raw, salt=nil, info="encedo-aes", L=32)`.

Use `ext_kid` to reference an imported peer public key by KID, or `pubkey` to pass
a raw base64-encoded peer public key. They are mutually exclusive.

### 7.4 Key wrap / unwrap (RFC 3394)

`POST /api/crypto/cipher/wrap` and `unwrap` use NIST AES Key Wrap:
- `alg`: `AES128`, `AES192`, or `AES256` (not the `-ECB`/`-GCM` suffixed forms)
- `msg`: key material to wrap must be a **multiple of 8 bytes**, minimum 16 bytes
- Response field: `wrapped` (wrap) or `unwrapped` (unwrap)

### 7.5 Signing algorithms and `ctx` field

| Key Type | Algorithms |
|---|---|
| ED25519 | `Ed25519`, `Ed25519ph`, `Ed25519ctx` |
| ED448 | `Ed448`, `Ed448ph` |
| SECP256R1/K1 | `SHA256WithECDSA`, `SHA384WithECDSA`, `SHA512WithECDSA` |
| SECP384R1 | `SHA256WithECDSA`, `SHA384WithECDSA`, `SHA512WithECDSA` |
| SECP521R1 | `SHA256WithECDSA`, `SHA384WithECDSA`, `SHA512WithECDSA` |

The `ctx` field (base64-encoded context data) is **required** for `Ed25519ph`,
`Ed25519ctx`, `Ed448`, and `Ed448ph`. Omit for all other algorithms.

### 7.6 Verify endpoints

Both `POST /api/crypto/hmac/verify` and `POST /api/crypto/exdsa/verify` return:
- **HTTP 200** (no body) on success
- **HTTP 406** on verification failure

There is no JSON body distinguishing valid from invalid — use the status code.

---

## 8. Device status quirks

### 8.1 `inited` field -- inverted logic

In `GET /api/system/status`:
- If the JSON object **contains the key `inited`** → device is **NOT** initialized
- If the key is **absent** → device **IS** initialized

This is opposite to intuition. The C implementation uses:
```c
out->initialized = !cJSON_HasObjectItem(root, "inited");
```

### 8.2 `ts` field absence

The `ts` (RTC time) field is absent from the status response when the RTC
is not set (before check-in). When present, the wire format is an ISO 8601
string such as `"2022-03-16T18:17:27Z"`, **not** a Unix integer (corrected
under MVP-OQ-1). Treat absence as `None`.

### 8.3 `hostname` field in status vs config

`GET /api/system/status` returns `hostname` **only** when the request `Host`
header differs from the device's configured hostname (per upstream spec,
corrected under MVP-OQ-3). Absence on the wire is the common case; treat
it as `None`.
`GET /api/system/config` returns a richer config including `eid`, `user`, `email`.
The `eid` from config is the same as the `eid` in the auth challenge and is needed
for PBKDF2 -- but caching it from the auth challenge is sufficient; no need to
call config just to get eid.

---

## 9. PPA vs EPA differences

| Feature | PPA (USB) | EPA (rack) |
|---|---|---|
| Default hostname | `my.ence.do` | `*.cloud.ence.do` |
| Storage endpoints | Available | HTTP 404 |
| Log file download | Available | HTTP 404 (uses MQTT syslog) |
| Shutdown endpoint | Available | Use reboot instead |
| Hardware version string | Contains "PPA" | Contains "EPA" |

Detect form factor from `GET /api/system/version` → `hwv` field.

---

## 10. Error handling reference

| HTTP Status | Meaning | Library action |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | Success | Parse response body |
| 400 | Bad request (malformed JSON, invalid arg) | Return error + body has detail |
| 401 | Missing or invalid JWT | Re-authenticate and retry once |
| 403 | Wrong scope or role | Check scope string; may need different token |
| 404 | Endpoint not available (EPA vs PPA) or key not found | Surface as not-found error |
| 406 | Operation failed: device already initialized (auth/init), verification failed (hmac/verify, exdsa/verify), duplicate key (keymgmt/import) | Context-dependent |
| 409 | Device in FLS failure state | Surface as device-failure error |
| 413 | POST body too large (>7300 bytes) | Validate before sending |
| 418 | TLS required for this endpoint | Device needs TLS provisioning |

---

## 11. C library structure (for reference bindings)

```
include/hem/
  hem.h          -- umbrella header (include this only)
  hem_types.h    -- all public structs and enums
  hem_system.h   -- system endpoints (version, status, checkin, config)
  hem_keymgmt.h  -- key management (create, delete, list, get)
  hem_crypto.h   -- crypto operations (encrypt, decrypt)

src/
  hem_ctx.c      -- context lifecycle
  hem_http.c     -- libcurl transport (FORBID_REUSE set here)
  hem_json.c     -- cJSON wrappers + base64 encode/decode
  hem_auth.c     -- eJWT construction + token cache (hem_auth_login, hem_auth_ensure)
  hem_system.c   -- system endpoint implementations
  hem_keymgmt.c  -- key management implementations
  hem_crypto.c   -- crypto endpoint implementations
  internal.h     -- full hem_ctx struct + internal function declarations
```

The `hem_auth_ensure(ctx, scope)` internal function is the key building block:
it checks whether the cached token matches the requested scope and is not near
expiry, and calls `hem_auth_login` if not. Every authenticated endpoint calls
this before making its HTTP request.
